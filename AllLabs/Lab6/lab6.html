 <p  style="font-size:25px">What is a Favicon?</p>
 <p style="font-size:25px" style="color:white">A favicon is an image that is shown next to the url link that is on the task bar/tabs of the browser you are using.  A favicon represents the website or can be the logo of the website you are on.</p>

 <p style="font-size:25px" >How do I add a favicon?</p>
 <p style="font-size:25px" >The way to add a Favicon you have to find an image you want as your logo or a symbol that represents you.  Add a the link code that allows the icon to display then add the name of the image so the computer can locate the image and add it as the Favicon.</p>

<br>
<img src="MyLogo.png" width="150px">
<p style="font-size:25px" >This is the the same logo as the black and white one but with color and with a lot of ones and zeros but in different combinations.</p>
<br>
<img src="longCode.png" width="150px">
<p style="font-size:25px" >This is the long code of the color version of my Logo</p>
<br>
<p style="font-size:25px" >What did I have to do in this lab?</p>
 <p style="font-size:25x" >This lab we needed to make a sketch of a logo that represents us.  After creating a sketch we need to make a black and white version of it on the computer using 1 and 0.  After we do that we need to make a color version of that black and white version we make. Lastly we have to make a banner for our website using photopea saying welcome.</p>
