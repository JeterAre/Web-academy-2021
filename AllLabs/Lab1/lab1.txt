		<h6> Jeter Arevalo </h6>
	<p> I am Jeter Arevalo in the 10th grade at Thomas A. Edison HS. I like to play videogames and hang out with my friends. 
	I play games like genshin impact and osu!. I am here because this is my CTE shop class. I am looking forward to learn how 
	to make websites and other coding things because I am interested in code and computers.I have only used java script before 
	but Im not very knowledgeable at it because I started to learn it a month ago. In life I don't really know what I want yet.
